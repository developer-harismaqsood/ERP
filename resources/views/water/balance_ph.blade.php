                        software-demand.com’s water system (EcoSystem in a Box) follows the natural spring water process of rocks. It uses no electricity and produces a pH of 9.0-9.5 on right side handle and 7.2-7.8 pH on left side handle creating a natural pH Balance.

                        The level of pH is quantified on a scale of zero to 14. The lower the pH, the more acidic, and the higher, the more alkaline. Neutral pH is 7.0, the pH of water and your level is in a healthy range between 6.0 to 7.5. According to Merck Manuals Online Medical Library, blood that is slightly alkaline, or 7.35 to 7.45, is optimal for proper body functions.
