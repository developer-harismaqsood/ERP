						<div class="description">
							<p>Filters are certified to last 12-18 months and are considered wear and tear. Therefore we can’t provide a warranty on filters due to the many variables that can change the filter's life cycle such as consumption volume and quality of the water in the area. By following the certified guidelines for filter localized configurations and proper maintenance schedules, the filter performance has exceeded many of our customer’s expectations.</p>
