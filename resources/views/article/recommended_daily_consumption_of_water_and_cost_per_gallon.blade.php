						<div class="description">
							<p >We’ve all heard that’s best. But the truth is, how much water you need varies, depending on how active you are and what type of climate you live in, among other things. Even if you’re not very active or live in a humid climate, you lose water every day through your breath, sweat, pee, and bowel movements.For men, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends a total of 13 cups (about 3 liters) of fluid -- period -- each day. For women, they suggest 9 cups (a little over 2 liters) of fluid -- total -- each day. Pregnant women should drink about 10 cups of water daily. Those who breastfeed need about 12 cups.</p>
							<p >If you’re outside on a hot day, or doing something that makes you sweat a lot, you’ll need to drink more fluids to stay hydrated. The same is true if you have an illness that causes you to throw up, have diarrhea, or run a fever. But if you have a condition like heart failure or a particular type of kidney disease, you may need to limit your fluid intake. Talk to your doctor about what’s right for you.</p>
