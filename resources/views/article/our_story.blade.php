							</p>
							<p class="mb-0">
								2014 November - Kenny Lu returned to Taiwan to develop and further the relationships with those people that he met on the previous trip. The spark came from a breakfast meeting between Kenny and a Chinese businessman, who has now become his respected mentor and guide in business and life. The two men saw eye to eye and heart to heart in their conversations about building a bridge between Asia and USA by developing businesses related to health, wellness, clean energy, clean water, clean air, and beauty products.
