					<p><strong>Post Installation Guidelines</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Water Leaks:</strong> Working with water filters may create a possibility of a water leak. Local sub-contractors have a warranty they provide for workmanship. The warranty period varies from different local sub-contractors. If a water leak happens, please contact your local sub-contractor company first, and you may also contact software-demand.com at 1-888-850-3743 for assistance.</p>

					<p><strong>Taste:</strong> The taste of software-demand.com water may take 2-3 days to improve and up to 2-3 weeks to fully optimize. The color of the water may be yellow or green on the first day or two of usage; therefore, flush the system 3-5 mins every morning before using during the first week.</p>

					<p><strong>Spluttering:</strong> It may take up to 2-4 weeks for all the air bubbles to come out of the 14 filters. At times the water flow will be spluttering, slow, dripping, and un-even. Please let the water run even though at times there might not be much coming out, and eventually it will even out. Flushing the system will help with water flow.</p>

					<p><strong>Faucet:</strong> software-demand.com uses a 316-L medical grade stainless steel faucet. You may see a slight drip from the faucet when the water is turned off, which may seem like the faucet has a leak. This occurrence is due to our highly micro-clustered water. We do not use any plastic to create air-tight seals, we only use medical grade stainless steel to maintain high quality, therefore a slight drip may occur from the faucet.</p>

					<p><strong>Maintenance Information</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Filter Capacity:</strong> software-demand.com filters' capacity is 1600 gallons flow-through or 12-18 months. There is a flow meter in the machine that will track the usage by gallons and our computer system will track the elapsed time for your filter change.</p>
