						<div class="description">
							<p class="mb-0">There are several mountain springs that attract millions of people annually due to the healing properties of the water. Scientists studied the layers of rocks and water content so that we could mimic the process and deliver an ECO System (Mountain in A box) into your home with pure, clean, safe and life promoting properties by software-demand.com.</p>

						<div class="description">
							<p >A water filter removes impurities by lowering contamination of water using a fine physical barrier, a chemical process, or a biological process. Filters cleanse water to different extents for purposes such as providing agricultural irrigation, accessible drinking water, public and private aquariums, and the safe use of ponds and swimming pools.</p>

						<div class="description">
							<p >Reverse osmosis (RO) is a water purification technology that uses a semipermeable membrane to remove ions, molecules and larger particles from drinking water. In reverse osmosis, an applied pressure is used to overcome osmotic pressure, a colligative property, that is driven by chemical potential differences of the solvent, a thermodynamic parameter.</p>

						<div class="description">
							<p >Distilled water is water that has been boiled into vapor and condensed back into liquid in a separate container. Impurities in the original water that do not boil below or at the boiling point of water remain in the original container. Thus, distilled water is one type of purified water.</p>

						<div class="description">
							<p >A water ionizer (also known as an alkaline ionizer) is a home appliance which raises the pH of drinking water by using electrolysis to separate the incoming water stream into acidic and alkaline components. The treated water is called alkaline water.</p>

						<div class="description">
							<p >Bottled water is drinking water (e.g., well water, distilled water, mineral water, or spring water) packaged in PET Bottle or Glass Water Bottles. Bottled water may be carbonated or not. Sizes range from small single serving bottles to large carboys for water coolers.</p>
